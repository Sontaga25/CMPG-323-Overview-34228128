**####Branching strategy **
The branching strategy that I'll be using throughout the semester in the various projects will be "feature branching." The reason I chose this strategy is that I'll be working alone throughout the semester, and because of that, there is no need for me to use complex branching strategies that are mostly suited for the development that usually takes place in groups. In addition to the abovementioned reasons, feature branching is suitable for short delivery cycles and continuous delivery, which is basically what we'll be doing throughout the semester.

The manner in which I'll be using this strategy is quite simple: there'll be a main branch, and for every feature I'll be working on, I'll be using different branches. Once I feel that the feature is ready and has no issues, I'll send pull requests to the main branch and merge the branch master into the main branch.

**#####use of .gitignore file withing each projec**t 
Within all the projects after this, all the .gitignore files will be used to ensure that no credentials and sensitive information are pushed to github and also that customizable application settings are not pushed to github.

##### Refer to above points for how credentials will be stored and senstive information will be saved
